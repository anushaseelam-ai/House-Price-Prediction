# House Price Prediction

## Project Overview

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict house prices using Python. The goal was to understand the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model evaluation — using a real dataset.

What I Did in This Project
1. Data Loading and Understanding

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. This is Business stragegy of real estate core in general.


#General Information

The data set consists of 1140 row and 81 columns.
Analysing this is core to find most influencing factors in price of house.
This will help US housing company to purchase house when the price is down in their new venture of Australian market by studying the behavior of people.

Imported required libraries like 
  Pandas
  NumPy 
  Matplotlib
  Scikit-learn.

2. Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values.

Converted categorical variables into numerical format.

Selected important features for prediction.

Prepared the target variable (house price).

3. Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyzed relationships between features and house price.

Used visualizations to understand trends and correlations.

Identified which features impact price the most.

4. Train-Test Split

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Ensured the model is evaluated on unseen data.

5. Model Building

Applied Linear Regression to train the model.

Generated predictions on test data.

6. Model Evaluation

  * Evaluated performance using:

  * Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)

  * R² Score

Analyzed how well the model predicts house prices.


## Skills Demonstrated

## Conclusion

Through this project, I implemented a complete machine learning pipeline for house price prediction. It helped me strengthen my understanding of regression models and real-world data handling.
